    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Kissan Connect ("we", "our", or "us") provides an agricultural assistance mobile application ("App") that helps farmers with weather forecasts, crop recommendation, disease prediction, AI assistant features, water calculator, crop diary, expense tracker, daily crop prices and related functions. For the list of features in your project, see the project file. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and the choices you have regarding your information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email address, phone number, and other details you provide when signing up.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile & farm data:</strong> optional data such as farm location, crops grown, field size, and preferences when you configure the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Crop diary & expense entries:</strong> text, dates, expenses, and any photos or notes you add to your diary or tracker.</li>
      <li><strong>Images for disease prediction:</strong> if you use disease prediction, you may upload or capture photos of plants — these images are processed as described below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device information:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, unique device identifiers (where permitted).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> analytics about how you use the app (features used, timestamps, crash reports) to improve the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Location data:</strong> approximate or precise location if you grant location permission (used for weather forecasts and localized recommendations).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Third-Party Data</h3>
    <p>
      We may receive information from third-party services you connect (for example, analytics providers). We do not sell your personal information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the App and its features (weather, crop recommendations, disease prediction, AI assistant, etc.).</li>
      <li>To process images and data you submit for disease detection and crop recommendations.</li>
      <li>To personalize content and suggestions based on your farm data and location.</li>
      <li>To send you transactional messages and important notices (account changes, policy updates).</li>
      <li>To analyze usage patterns and diagnose technical issues to improve the App.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect against misuse.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Permissions & Optional Features</h2>
    <p>The App may request optional permissions to enable certain features. You can choose not to grant these permissions; core features that require them will not function without consent.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> used for local weather and region-specific recommendations.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera:</strong> to capture plant photos for disease detection.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage / Photos:</strong> to upload or save images and diary entries.</li>
      <li><strong>Network access:</strong> required for fetching weather, price data, cloud-based AI processing, and updates.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Image & AI Processing</h2>
    <p>
      When you submit plant images for disease prediction, images may be processed locally on your device or sent to our secure servers (or third-party AI service) for analysis depending on the app configuration. Only the data necessary for prediction is used. We will retain images only as long as required to provide the feature, unless you explicitly allow longer storage (for example, to keep a crop diary).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share information in the following limited cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> trusted vendors who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, AI processing). They are contractually required to protect your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> to comply with the law, protect rights, or respond to lawful requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> if we merge, are acquired, or sell assets, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction under confidentiality obligations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the services and for a reasonable period after to meet legal or operational needs. You can request deletion of your account and personal data; see the "Your Rights" section below.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access & correction:</strong> you can view or correct certain account information via the app settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete account:</strong> request deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us. Deletion requests may take up to 30 days to process and some logs may be retained for legal compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> you may opt-out of non-essential analytics and marketing communications.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child provided us with personal information, please contact us to request deletion.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect personal information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-Party Links & Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may contain links to third-party websites, APIs, or services (for example, weather providers or price feeds). This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party services; review their privacy policies before use.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Analytics and Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We may use analytics services to understand usage patterns and improve the App. If we display ads, we will disclose the advertising partners and provide opt-out instructions where required by applicable law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      If data is transferred across borders (for hosting or AI processing), we will protect it consistent with applicable legal requirements and industry practice.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we'll post a notice in the App and update the effective date above.
    </p>
